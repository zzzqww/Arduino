TIME PERCEPTION TRAINER

Background：
In an unprecedented space, different creatures live together and explore other planets. But for different planets, time is different. For example, when you think that one day has passed on planet X, a year may have passed on Earth. (Einstein mentioned in the theory of relativity that not only the speed of light can change time, but gravity can also change time. Gravity can distort space-time.) So when "creatures" travel through time and space to a new planet, they will face time the disappearance speed is different from the original situation.

Aim：
The "Time Perception Trainer" is a kind of machine that can help "creatures" better perceive the time lapse speed of their planet based on the time of the original survival planet. It will let the creature accurately grasp "1 second" of the original planet under different time speeds.

Interactive process:
1. Set the time relationship between the original survival planet and the current planet
2. Press button - Wait - Release button
3. The number of LEDs display as the length of time when press the 
   （You may think that the time has passed five seconds, but only three seconds have passed）
4. Until the number of LEDs displayed is the same as “the waiting time” in your thinking. Then you will gradually form a unified concept of time in your feeling 
    (for example, if you thinking time passed 5 seconds, and you could turn on the five LEDs as well, the perception of time is unified)
